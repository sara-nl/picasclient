Autopiloting
============

This example shows how to automatically start a picas client (or pilot) to process tokens from the database.
While this example explicitly shows the case of two types of tokens, that is single-core and multi-core work, you can adjust the code to:
 - Run for a single view, such as your default tokens.
 - Add more than the 2 views, to process as many types of tokens as you want (where type could also be GPU, high-memory, or other properties of a job).
 - Add properties to the tokens in your "pushTokens" code, such as 
    - "gpu: 1" and start a GPU-based job
    - "time: 72:00:00" and then start a job with a 3-day walltime
    - "cores: 8" and start a high-memory job

This can be achieved by adjusting:
 1. The view code to create all the necessary views
 2. The scanner code to scan these views and submit the necessary jobs
 3. The job scripts (.sh) that end up in slurm / your scheduler
 4. The pilot jobs that scan the views containing the work
 5. Finally, The tokens need to be available in your database
